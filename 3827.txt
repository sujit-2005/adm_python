3827. Count Monobit Integers

Question:
 
You are given an integer n.

An integer is called Monobit if all bits in its binary representation are the same.

Return the count of Monobit integers in the range [0, n] (inclusive).


Example 1:

Input: n = 1

Output: 2

Explanation:

The integers in the range [0, 1] have binary representations "0" and "1".
Each representation consists of identical bits. Thus, the answer is 2.
Example 2:

Input: n = 4

Output: 3

Explanation:

The integers in the range [0, 4] include binaries "0", "1", "10", "11", and "100".
Only 0, 1 and 3 satisfy the Monobit condition. Thus, the answer is 3.

Solution: 

class Solution:
    def countMonobit(self, n: int) -> int:
        l=list(range(0,n+1))
        count=0
        for i in l:
            if i==0:
                count+=1
            elif i & (i+1)==0:
                count+=1
        return count
